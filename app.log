Bit spicy even for a normal Indian origin person so tell them in advance for medium spicy. Quantity or portion size are very good two people can easily share. Quality & taste is very good.  Rehriwale Dahi bhalle was a bit disappointing. Overall Good value for money. Their dal makhani and naan are highly recommended.

2024-11-07 14:29:24,383 - app_logger - INFO - Retrieved review for review 2: 4 stars because Karan was simply amazing.

We ordered take-out; two chicken entr√©es, and I really, really wanted to like it, but, it was too oily and had 3 small pieces of chicken, nan bread was small and too thin. And since we stayed at a hotel, our food was not placed into two plates, instead the rice was all in one container and had no utensils. The flavor however is good.

Karan has amazing customer skills. I'll be going back to give it a second chance next time I visit Tempe.

Ordered Papadi Chaat and it was lip smacking ! The Papadi itself was freshly fried, I think. Tasty and I could feel the freshness.
Dahi bhalle was equally delicious. Best part was - curd wasn't sweet! A rarity! Enjoyed a lot.

Will visit again for proper lunch / dinner food.

Servers were friendly and though it was taking a while for food to be served, I enjoyed the ambience of the place.

Food: first off those little thin chips that break and you dip dip in the sauces. Amazing texture and the flavor was perfect. This was the first mango lassi that I actually liked. It was so good, I forgot I didn't like them. Then the samosas came out. They were full, packed to the rim with delicious flavor. We ordered Paneer "naan" with the tikka masala. We will ALWAYS come here now.

Service: you know that feeling of going over to grandmas house and you know you are loved, you are safe and you know you're gonna eat GOOD? Same same. We were treated so well and even though it was close to closing time we only felt appreciation from them for us coming in. Drinks were always full, Nick was so welcoming and really made it a great experience.

Ambiance: from the outside it feels like an adventure. The second you open the door and get a whiff of what's been cooking you know you made a good decision. The waiting area was comfortable and had a good aesthetic for the restaurant. The plate ware, cups and silverware were unique and fit the restaurant vibe perfectly.

Are we going back? Absolutely!

We ordered the chicken pad Thai and pineapple chicken fried rice. The flavors were so rich and delicious. The cool part was being able to customize any dish with protein options and spiciness level. We also got the pot-stickers and fried banana ice cream (FBI) and they were equally delicious. The atmosphere was very quaint and welcoming. I would highly recommend this place.

I was excited to have dinner here. I ordered the pineapple fried rice and pad thai, choosing a level 2 spiciness for both dishes, as offered by most Thai restaurants.

When the dishes arrived, they smelled fantastic. The pineapple fried rice, made with curry powder and pineapple, was particularly addictive with its mix of sour and spicy flavors. However, my friend mentioned that the rice was a bit too wet. The pad thai, on the other hand, was just okay; it lacked the bold flavor of the fried rice, and the beef was dry and tough.

Overall, the food was decent and the prices were reasonable. The restaurant's d√©cor is also a nice touch, with plenty of elements that remind me of Thailand.

Came here with husband and ordered drunken noodles (amazing dish to try!) pad see ew which I had in California (love this dish especially because it's a bit sweeter) and the Thai fried rice which I would highly recommend to go with anything you order!  What a ton of food  that came out hot, quick, and was so good!  Could not stop eating even after I was so full.  The place was quiet for a Friday night, very comfortable and small restaurant but beautifully lit and very clean.  Our server was so patient with us, very helpful in making selections carefully to fit our needs especially since I've had Thai food once and my husband's never had it.  Even though he's never been receptive to trying it, I finally convinced him and he's ready to back and try more as am I!  Highly recommend!  Bill after tip for iced teas and 3 entrees was $50 and we were very happy with it!

The only good thing is food is prepared quickly. But the way they've cut corners on their dishes has unfortunately really, really impacted the quality of their food.

Drunken noodle - Taste was so off. I noticed color looked a little weird, thought nothing of it. But I couldn't taste the palm sugar or oyster sauce or anything that usually goes into pad kee mao. Noodles had been overcooked and no longer chewy, only disintegrated in your mouth with an unpleasant texture. Veggies cut poorly (chunky), seemed more appropriate for a stir fry. Because of this, some of them were cooked unevenly. Not a good order.

Mango sticky rice - it's hard to mess this up, but this could also be improved. Mango was nice, but this was the blandest mango sticky rice I've ever had. I'm pretty sure they only used coconut milk to top the rice, and maybe cooked the glutinous rice with some minor sweetener. Mango was nice and ripe but I feel the rest of the dish was lacking in support.

Just a really disappointing experience with Thai Basil here. To me, this is another symptom of a restaurant located in a college town. There are many other thai places in the area that I'll explore instead.

Some dishes are more expensive and as a college student, I'm always looking for the biggest bang for my buck. It's best to get takeout from Thai Basil, you will get so much more food. It's a 5/5 for takeout and the dishes i mentioned but of course I have to take the atmosphere into consideration. The restaurant is quite dim and service can be slower if you do order at a busy time. The staff is extremely sweet though and would always love to offer suggestions.

I love Thai Basil's curry! I prefer green curry, but the yellow curry (pictured) is also excellent. Both the curry flavor and consistency are spot-on with a generous portion.

I enjoy the pad see ew and pad thai as both have rich flavors. However, in general I find the vegetables to be a bit too crunchy/undercooked.

The food was still hot when I got home about 25 minutes later! I ordered pad Thai, pad see ew, spring rolls and red curry. The pad Thai is the best! I ordered it with chicken and it was delicious. The portion was so large that I only finished half of it. The pad see ew was ordered with tofu for my sister and she enjoyed it! The red curry was ordered with chicken and my boyfriend loved it. It came with white rice. The spring rolls were tasty with the sweet and sour dipping sauce.

They gave us some extra spring rolls I'm pretty sure! And lots of extra dipping sauces. That was a lovely surprise!

Love this place!

We have so many options in Tempe for Thai but I'm fairly set on this location next to ASU (even during the school year). Usually I order online or carry out, and with both options, it's never taken forever! Service is so fast. Anytime I go in for carry out there's always a decent crowd there. I know the lunch specials are amazing for the price just as in general for combo meals.

Usually I order Pad Thai or yellow curry and a side like pot stickers or spring rolls... good for a few meals. I know people can be quite particular for spice level... even on the low end (what I order) it is pretty flavorful and not overtly spicy. Spring rolls are better than the pot stickers. Feels like in the last few years the noodle to meat/veggie ratio has gone up.

Both were ordered with medium spicy, but didn't have much flavor/spice. Both dishes came with a spring roll which was tasty. Next time placing an order will order spicier. The highlight was the eggplant in the green curry.
