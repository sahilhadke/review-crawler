We were greeted when we entered and lead upstairs for cocktails and appetizers. Everything was so good. Service was very attentive. Different chefs explained each dish to the diners. The head chef encouraged every to come up to the pass to chat with them. Can't wait to come back and see what's different after the remodel.",

Choicest of ingredients prepared with passion and served spectacularly with panache. It\u2019s as good as fine dining gets. Besides the warmth and attentiveness of the staff, wanna call out how they go above and beyond in ensuring that it\u2019s one of your most memorable nights dining out. An anecdote is, one of the servers noted our interest in hot sauces from my questions about the dishes, and we had an experimental hot sauce to-go from the chef with our breakfast for next day. Can\u2019t recommend Lazy Bear enough \ud83d\udc3b",

It was rich in flavor but still not heavy. The staff makes you feel comfortable. The service is amazing because they are not stiff and yet make you feel very attended. The atmosphere is fun like dark cabin in the mountains like cozy and grand. I will for sure come back in the future.",

I found the butter, trout soup, shrimp grill and a couple of other dishes way too salty. Not the best Michelin-starred restaurants I have been to. Not great for value.",

        "review": "Lazy Bear is another amazing dining experience in San Francisco. The menu offers a woodsy flair with foraged ingredients. Interesting and unexpected flavors such as pine are incorporated really well into the menu. The seafood is handled expertly. It is also a great place for lamb/mutton lover as two types of really delicious lamb chops are served for main protein. Desserts are exceptional especially the blueberry course. The draw back is that couple dishes are heavily salted for my taste, for example the butter course. Wine pairing is great. I really recommend the Yquem flight for the dessert. The Yquem sommelier is very knowledgeable and fun to chat to if you love Yquem. Service is top notch. As a solo dining guest, I really appreciate that the staff keep up with my pace and did not make me sit through 2-3 hours for dinner. Overall, this was quite an unforgettable dinner for me.",

The staff is highly attentive and knowledgable of all of the food and beverage offerings, which is a lot of information to process. Despite the fine dining flavors and service, the restaurant is unpretentious with an inviting and cozy atmosphere and no formal dress code. You are treated like a guest, not a customer which is the level of service that should be expected when spending Michelin prices.",
