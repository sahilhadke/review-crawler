But they do a really great job getting the customers through and getting food out. With the amount of raw meat products they handle, you would think of cross contamination but let me tell you they handle all raw products appropriately. They probably used 4-5 different tongs to grab various meats to prevent any contamination.\n\nThe atmosphere was a bit off putting, but a lot of had to do with the customers. But because of its location and historic aspect, the dining within is on the smaller side, considering how many customers they get. It didn\u2019t help that customers who had been finished eating remained sitting for another 20 minutes while people were looking for a place to sit, thats neither here nor there.\n\nThe food is where the rating really comes from. My wife and I weren\u2019t overly impressed with the taste of the food. We aren\u2019t quite sure how there were so many raving reviews about the food. The hamburgers that we had were not seasoned and tasted that of plain burgers which didn\u2019t impress us. The fried onions were overly fried and sat under a heat lamp, to include the fried zucchini. With the rating it currently holds and the reviews we read, we were expecting some tasty and delicious burgers and unfortunately thats not what we got. Granted I would put it up higher than fast food burgers but for the cost, it wouldn\u2019t cheaper to get fast food.",

Added some condiments from the condiment bar where everyone\u2019s dirty, nasty digits also spoon out ketchup, mustard, pickles, mayo, etc. Not a fan of community condiments. In a nutshell, to me, it\u2019s a hipster Burger King. I honestly didn\u2019t see a huge difference between this burger and a flame broiled whopper. If you love this place, good for you. Enjoy.
