The flavors were so rich and delicious. The cool part was being able to customize any dish with protein options and spiciness level. We also got the pot-stickers and fried banana ice cream (FBI) and they were equally delicious. The atmosphere was very quaint and welcoming. I would highly recommend this place.",

I ordered the pineapple fried rice and pad thai, choosing a level 2 spiciness for both dishes, as offered by most Thai restaurants.\n\nWhen the dishes arrived, they smelled fantastic. The pineapple fried rice, made with curry powder and pineapple, was particularly addictive with its mix of sour and spicy flavors. However, my friend mentioned that the rice was a bit too wet. The pad thai, on the other hand, was just okay; it lacked the bold flavor of the fried rice, and the beef was dry and tough.\n\nOverall, the food was decent and the prices were reasonable. The restaurant's d\u00e9cor is also a nice touch, with plenty of elements that remind me of Thailand.",

Came here with husband and ordered drunken noodles (amazing dish to try!) pad see ew which I had in California (love this dish especially because it's a bit sweeter) and the Thai fried rice which I would highly recommend to go with anything you order!  What a ton of food  that came out hot, quick, and was so good!  Could not stop eating even after I was so full.  The place was quiet for a Friday night, very comfortable and small restaurant but beautifully lit and very clean.  Our server was so patient with us, very helpful in making selections carefully to fit our needs especially since I've had Thai food once and my husband's never had it.  Even though he's never been receptive to trying it, I finally convinced him and he's ready to back and try more as am I!  Highly recommend!  Bill after tip for iced teas and 3 entrees was $50 and we were very happy with it!",

We ordered Thai iced teas and Thai Iced coffee and they were a fantastic way to start - they were huge too! We ordered family style and shared several dishes - all were amazing: flavorful, well presented, good portions. It's always a little risky taking guests to someplace new but this will definitely join our favorites list!",
