        "review": "Not happy to give this place a poor review. I love Thai food and know what it's supposed to taste like. The only good thing is food is prepared quickly. But the way they've cut corners on their dishes has unfortunately really, really impacted the quality of their food.\n\nDrunken noodle - Taste was so off. I noticed color looked a little weird, thought nothing of it. But I couldn't taste the palm sugar or oyster sauce or anything that usually goes into pad kee mao. Noodles had been overcooked and no longer chewy, only disintegrated in your mouth with an unpleasant texture. Veggies cut poorly (chunky), seemed more appropriate for a stir fry. Because of this, some of them were cooked unevenly. Not a good order.\n\nMango sticky rice - it's hard to mess this up, but this could also be improved. Mango was nice, but this was the blandest mango sticky rice I've ever had. I'm pretty sure they only used coconut milk to top the rice, and maybe cooked the glutinous rice with some minor sweetener. Mango was nice and ripe but I feel the rest of the dish was lacking in support.\n\nJust a really disappointing experience with Thai Basil here. To me, this is another symptom of a restaurant located in a college town. There are many other thai places in the area that I'll explore instead."

The server was friendly and attentive.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I ordered the beef salad, bbq chicken, shrimp and tofu pad thai. The beef salad was very flavorful with a large serving amount of beef. The bbq chicken was. delicious with the sauce.\n\nThe pad thai was a little on the bitter side. The pad thai was not my favorite dish but everything else was delicious."

The food was pretty good (ordered spring rolls and a curry). The medium spice level is spicy enough where you may want something to wash it down with but not so spicy that it takes away from the flavor. That said I will probably order the mild in the future"

        "review": "Depending on what you get, Thai Basil can be pretty amazing. My fav dish of theirs is the chicken katsu or chicken curry. Some dishes are more expensive and as a college student, I'm always looking for the biggest bang for my buck. It's best to get takeout from Thai Basil, you will get so much more food. It's a 5/5 for takeout and the dishes i mentioned but of course I have to take the atmosphere into consideration. The restaurant is quite dim and service can be slower if you do order at a busy time. The staff is extremely sweet though and would always love to offer suggestions."

I prefer green curry, but the yellow curry (pictured) is also excellent. Both the curry flavor and consistency are spot-on with a generous portion.\n\nI enjoy the pad see ew and pad thai as both have rich flavors. However, in general I find the vegetables to be a bit too crunchy/undercooked."

I ordered pad Thai, pad see ew, spring rolls and red curry. The pad Thai is the best! I ordered it with chicken and it was delicious. The portion was so large that I only finished half of it. The pad see ew was ordered with tofu for my sister and she enjoyed it! The red curry was ordered with chicken and my boyfriend loved it. It came with white rice. The spring rolls were tasty with the sweet and sour dipping sauce.\n\nThey gave us some extra spring rolls I'm pretty sure! And lots of extra dipping sauces. That was a lovely surprise!\n\nLove this place!"

Usually I order online or carry out, and with both options, it's never taken forever! Service is so fast. Anytime I go in for carry out there's always a decent crowd there. I know the lunch specials are amazing for the price just as in general for combo meals.\n\nUsually I order Pad Thai or yellow curry and a side like pot stickers or spring rolls... good for a few meals. I know people can be quite particular for spice level... even on the low end (what I order) it is pretty flavorful and not overtly spicy. Spring rolls are better than the pot stickers. Feels like in the last few years the noodle to meat/veggie ratio has gone up."

Both dishes came with a spring roll which was tasty. Next time placing an order will order spicier. The highlight was the eggplant in the green curry."
