Quantity or portion size are very good two people can easily share. Quality & taste is very good.  Rehriwale Dahi bhalle was a bit disappointing. Overall Good value for money. Their dal makhani and naan are highly recommended.",

And since we stayed at a hotel, our food was not placed into two plates, instead the rice was all in one container and had no utensils. The flavor however is good.\n\nKaran has amazing customer skills. I'll be going back to give it a second chance next time I visit Tempe.",
