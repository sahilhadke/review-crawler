The Papadi itself was freshly fried, I think. Tasty and I could feel the freshness.\nDahi bhalle was equally delicious. Best part was - curd wasn't sweet! A rarity! Enjoyed a lot.\n\nWill visit again for proper lunch / dinner food.\n\nServers were friendly and though it was taking a while for food to be served, I enjoyed the ambience of the place."

        "review": "Came here on a whim, and we immediately fell in love. We got there a little late but they still accommodated (We had planned on a to go order but they invited us to stay).\n\nFood: first off those little thin chips that break and you dip dip in the sauces. Amazing texture and the flavor was perfect. This was the first mango lassi that I actually liked. It was so good, I forgot I didn't like them. Then the samosas came out. They were full, packed to the rim with delicious flavor. We ordered Paneer \"naan\" with the tikka masala. We will ALWAYS come here now.\n\nService: you know that feeling of going over to grandmas house and you know you are loved, you are safe and you know you're gonna eat GOOD? Same same. We were treated so well and even though it was close to closing time we only felt appreciation from them for us coming in. Drinks were always full, Nick was so welcoming and really made it a great experience.\n\nAmbiance: from the outside it feels like an adventure. The second you open the door and get a whiff of what's been cooking you know you made a good decision. The waiting area was comfortable and had a good aesthetic for the restaurant. The plate ware, cups and silverware were unique and fit the restaurant vibe perfectly.\n\nAre we going back? Absolutely!\nShould you go? 100%"
