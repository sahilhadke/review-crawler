So often I worked with Google Ads Agents feeling even more confused about the ads I ran, than when I set them up on my own. Corey has made this process much easier to understand. With his assistance I've been able to better focus my advertising dollars and see the kinds of return I never achieved with the Google Ads Agents. No more Google Ads Agents, I'm only working with Advertiser Advisors."

He is consistent in his deployment and management of ad campaigns. He is on time with reporting, and he's always available to answer clients questions.\n\nIn all the years I've known him, I've only seen him loose one client ... they were very difficult to work with .... and they disengaged from working with me also.\n\nThe rest of the clients that we have shared have stayed with him for at least 3 years, some even longer.\n\nYou don't stay with someone doing PPC if the ROI isn't there.\n\nI don't know the specifics of how much ROI these clients are getting, but they all are growing and sticking with Corey."

        "review": "It's taken me awhile to write this because I've wrestled about keeping the best kept marketing secret to myself. However that just wouldn't be ethical or good karma.\nSo as a small business owner you know how everyone wants your business and tells you they can increase your ROA as well as, automate you to get you more business etc etc. After trying a few places some well known and big agencies that almost tanked my business, I was hesitant to try an outside source one more time. It had gotten to the point where outside marketing was just really good at taking your $ and you got very little in return. Do to those experiences, I decided I had to learn all the marketing myself. In the meantime I became a FB ads expert and started to pursue google. Heck Google even gives you free person to your account. Which at first was good and then they were worthless. Being a small business and busy the thought of having to learn how to excel at one more platform made me want to throw up. I hesitantly spoke to Corey. His plan was great and if he sucked I was only out 1 month and I thought it was worth the risk.\nI am here to tell you it's the best investment I've made this year. I might be intuitive but Corey is the data guy with the numbers, yet he always listens to my thoughts and together we come up with a plan that is exciting. Beyond that it absolutely works. So much that I don't worry about certain things anymore. It's really nice to have someone you can absolutely trust. Corey is the real deal. I recommend  not just taking my word for it. See for yourself do a month even if it's not fast and furious at first hang in there for 1 more month you'll thank me that you did!\nCorey Is The Google Marketing Shizit In My Book!!!\nThank you for being someone I can trust and helping me have a plan that has super return on my investment!"
